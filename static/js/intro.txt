select your sample number from the dropdown menu. Hover over the pie pieces to see the relative abundance of a given species. Click the buttons next to the species names to remove dominant species and reveal smaller pieces of the pie.</br>
What species are present in your navel? What is the relative abundance of your common species? Do some species dominate more than others? Who are these species? You can learn more by reading profiles of the most common species.</br>
Compare yourself to the "average" belly button to the right.</br> How different or similar are you? Browse the charts of other participants. What species do you have in common with others? Are your common species more or less abundant than those found in others? What factors do you think might be shaping these differences? Can't find your sample? We analyzed belly button samples in two batches and thus built two different interactive pie charts. We recommend checking out the other interactive chart for your sample. Tried that and still can't find your sample? Unfortunately, this means that something happened in the analysis pipeline such that we failed to get good quality DNA from your sample. This happens from time to time when we process a lot of samples. In some ways, our molecular approach is kind of like baking. If you make hundreds of cakes, every once in a while one just doesn't come out right.
